## How to run
Make sure you have Node and NPM installed

For iOS, you need XCode installed before running the following command.
Instructions for Android will come.

Next, run the following:
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

You will only need to install this once.

To run the mobile version, run the following:

### iOS (Can only run on Mac OS)

```
npm install
react-native run-ios
```

### Android (Any operating systems)

```
npm install
react-native run-android
```
